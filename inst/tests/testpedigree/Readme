This test files check a variety of different pedigrees, mostly created or
found by Curtis Olswold, that caused the pedigree plotting function to fail
at one time or another.  The file testplots.R demonstrates how to further
manipulate the plots (add in a spouse w/ no kids, rearrange siblings,
etc.).  The postscript files provide examples of what the plots should look
like - there isn't any direct way to compare the plots other than looking
at them.
