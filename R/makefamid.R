# Create a vector of length n, giving the family "tree" number of
#  each subject.  If the pedigree is totally connected, then everyone will
#  end up in tree 1, otherwise the tree numbers represent the disconnected
#  subfamilies.  Singleton subjects give a zero for family number.
# This is needed to run "kinship" is a sensible fashion, one disjoint group
#  at a time.

makefamid <- function(id, father.id, mother.id) {
    n <- length(id)
    mid  <- c(match(mother.id, id, nomatch=n+1), n+1)
    did  <- c(match(father.id, id, nomatch=n+1), n+1)

    # The key idea of the algorithm:
    #  1. iteratively set the family id of parent/child sets to the
    #       minimum value of the set
    #  2. add a subject "n+1", who is the parent of all orphans, and
    #       also of himself, to make the father/mother/child vectors
    #       all be the same length

    # Run the depth routine to check for impossible parentage loops,
    #  which would lead to infinite iterations.
    # And even then, give it an upper limit of n iterations (it should
    #   never even come close to this).  You might think it would finish in
    #   max(depth) iterations, but assume 2 families of depth 3 who intermarry
    #   at the last generation: the final id propogates down one tree and
    #   then up the other.  Chains can take even longer (child of A marries
    #   child of B, second child of B marries child of C, second child of C
    #   marries child of D, ...).  However, at each iteration the final number
    #   must get propogated to at least one child or at least 2 parents, giving
    #   a limit of n-1
